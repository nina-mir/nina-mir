### Hallo! 👋
  
My name is Nina. :rainbow: :transgender_flag:	:bike:	 
I am a web developer with experience in frontend and data analysis/visualization. 
I am also a literary writer. My published works are listed ➡️ [here!](https://nina-mir.github.io/words/)

```My master's project got a 2nd rank in the research competition by SF State University in May 2023. It is now accepted as a poster for the IEEE VIS 2023 conference in Australia!``` :partying_face:

- :bulb:	**I am currently looking for a software development, data, backend, frontened role in SF Bay Area 🌉 or 🇩🇪 !**
