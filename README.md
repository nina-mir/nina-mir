## [October 2025]
  #### Built a full stack project ingesting data from WindBorne Systems' live constellation API to be used in two plots made by d3.js:
  - a worldmap displaying each flight trajectory in a 24-hr interval
  - a Sankey chart to display the starting/ending region of each trajectory using geonames.org and nominatim.openstreetmap.org APIs
  #### The project depends on an automated datapipeline that fetches and processes new data hourly [on an Ubuntu cloud server] and uses CLoudflare Workers to edge-cache the data files
